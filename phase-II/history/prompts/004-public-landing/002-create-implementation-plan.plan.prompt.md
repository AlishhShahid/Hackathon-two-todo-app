## Prompt

Public Landing Page for Todo Application

Reference Specification:
- Generated by Landing Page Architect agent
- Target audience: first-time visitors, unauthenticated users
- Focus: Hero section, Features section, CTA buttons, responsive design
- Success criteria: fast, SEO-friendly, accessible, fully public

Planning Objective:
- Break down the landing page specification into actionable, sequential implementation steps
- Define front-end components, layout, and routing
- Identify dependencies on existing routes (login/register)
- Ensure tasks are suitable for automation by the Landing Page Architect agent

Plan Structure:
1. Hero Section
2. Features Section
3. Call-To-Action Section
4. Navigation / Header
5. Footer
6. Meta & SEO
7. Responsiveness & Accessibility
8. Integration Tasks
9. Testing & Validation

Constraints:
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- No backend logic required

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan with:

**Phase 0 - Research** (`research.md`):
- Analyzed current auth-redirect homepage conflict
- Decided on Server Components for performance
- Established component architecture in `components/landing/`
- Documented SEO strategy using Next.js Metadata API

**Phase 1 - Design** (`data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`):
- Defined static content entities (Hero, Features, Metadata)
- No database changes needed - all content is static
- Created quickstart guide for development

**Implementation Plan** (`plan.md`):
- 5 phases with 14 tasks total
- Mapped each task to success criteria
- File change summary: 1 modify, 3 create
- All dependencies verified (login/register routes exist)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation roadmap ready for task generation
- 🧪 Tests: Testing tasks defined (T012, T013, T014)
- 📁 Files: 4 files created (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate detailed task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Key insight - current page.tsx needs complete replacement, not modification

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - plan generated successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution check PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.plan flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
